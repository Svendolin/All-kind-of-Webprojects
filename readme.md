## &nbsp;SCSS / SASS: âœ… 
***
**Some Notes about SASS / SCSS:**
* SASS is a CSS preprocessor, which means that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more. It also helps to keep things organised and allows you to create style sheets faster.
* SASS is completely compatible with all versions of CSS but needs to be compiled into CSS before it can be used in a browser.
