## &nbsp;FLEXBOX and GRID-LAYOUT âœ… 
***
**Some notes about GRID:**
* GRID LAYOUT is a two-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a one-dimensional system. Grid tends to be better for larger applications, while flexbox is better for smaller components.
* Be sure to CHECK OUT [GRID LAYOUT-IT GENERATOR](https://grid.layoutit.com/) for a quick and easy way to create a grid layout!
* If you want to play games to learn grid, check out [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) and [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/).

**Some notes about FLEXBOX:**
* FLEX BOX is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or columns. It helps you distribute space among items in an interface and align them neatly.
* Be sure to CHECK OUT [ANGRYTOOLS FLEXBOX GENERATOR](https://angrytools.com/css-flex/) for a quick and easy way to create a flexbox layout!
* If you want to play games to learn flexbox, check out [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Flexbox Defense](http://www.flexboxdefense.com/).

## &nbsp;SCSS / SASS: âœ… 
***
**Some Notes about SASS / SCSS:**
* SASS is a CSS preprocessor, which means that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, nested rules, mixins (*), inline imports, and more. It also helps to keep things organised and allows you to create style sheets faster.
* SASS is completely compatible with all versions of CSS but needs to be compiled into CSS before it can be used in a browser.

**How to start:**
1) Go to Extensions in VSC and search for "Live Sass Compiler" and install it (optionally as well as SASS Syntax Highlighting)
2) Create a new file with the extension .scss (like style.scss)
2) Then go to the bottom right corner and click on "Watch Sass" and you're good to go (generates a .map file as well which has a function to map the compiled CSS to the source code) -> You will receive two more files: style.css and style.css.map

**How to continue:**

* SCSS is "super" and stronger than CSS, which means all the changes you make in like "style.SCSS" will be compiled into "style.CSS" and will be applied to your website. It does everything automatically for you.

**What's the difference between SASS and SCSS?**
* SCSS still uses {} like:
```scss

$main-color: #ff0000;

h1 {
  color: $main-color;
}
```
...while SASS uses indentation without {} as Python does like:
```scss
$main-color: #ff0000;

h1 
  color: $main-color;

```

**1) MIXINS:**
* Mixins are a way to reuse styles. They are similar to functions in that they take arguments and return a value. They are different in that they are not limited to returning a single value. They can also output multiple lines of CSS.

```scss
// Mixin example 1 without arguments
@mixin rightCorner() {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 35vw;
}

// Mixin example 2 with arguments
@mixin circle($size, $bgColor: #ff8a98) {
  width: $size;
  height: $size;
  background-color: $bgColor;
  border-radius: 50%;
}

// Class which uses the mixin 1 and 2
.circle {
  @include rightCorner();
  @include circle(600px); // $size = 600px. Order is crucial!
}
```

**2) EXTEND:**
* Extend is a way to share a set of CSS properties from one selector / classes to another. It helps keep your Sass / Scss very DRY.

```scss

.button-main {
  @extend .button; // extend the .button class (Additionally receive all basic values from .button)
  background-color: $main-color;
  margin-right: 10px;
  color: white;
}

```

**3) NESTING:**
* Nesting with & is a way to write CSS more efficiently. It allows you to nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. It helps keep the DRY principle.

```scss

li a {
  display: block;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: white;
  // Nesting: With the & symbol, we can nest the pseudo-class inside the selector
  &:hover {
    color: $main-color;
  }  
}
```
**4) DIVIDE AND CONQUER:**
* Divide and Conquer is a way to split your CSS into multiple files. It helps keep your code DRY and organised.

```scss
// 1) Create new folder and name it "scss" (or whatever you want)
// 2) Create a new file like fonts.scss and add some code (there will be a .css and .css.map generated as well)
// 3) Go to your main file (style.scss) and import the new file like:
@import "scss/company-colors";
@import "scss/fonts";
// 4) To see live-server changes just save the main style.css file and the changes will be applied to your website

```

**Some Notes about Bootstrap:**
* Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components.
